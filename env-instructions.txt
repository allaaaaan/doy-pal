Environment Variables Setup Instructions
======================================

The admin API is failing because of missing environment variables. 
Please update your .env.local file to include these variables:

SUPABASE_URL=https://rwierjoauxrzhsyaajeo.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY=your-supabase-secret-key-here

Replace "your-supabase-secret-key-here" with your actual Supabase secret key.

After updating the .env.local file, restart the development server with:
npm run dev

Notes:
- These variables are used server-side only in API routes
- Using SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY is correct since they aren't exposed to the client
